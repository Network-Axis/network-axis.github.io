								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>We understand that small to medium sized organizations must cope with the same cybersecurity threats as larger companies, but do not have the same resources available for enhancing security. That is why we specialize in securing network infrastructure and designing scalable architecture crafted for any size organization.</p>
								<p>At Network Axis, our mission is to determine the network security needs for each organization and provide cost-effective strategies that meet industry standards and exceed customer expectations. We believe every business has the right to robust network security in order to stay protected and competitive.</p>
								<p>View our <a href="#services">Services</a> to learn how to protect your network, identify threats, and measure the effectiveness of your existing security controls.</p>
